# Reasons to use machine learning
An example of a business problem where the use of ML would be appropriate is generating personalized recommendations. In this case, the solution to the problem requires complex logic, and you would want to provide personalized recommendations at scale with quick turnaround times.

## Use ML when it requires
1. `complex logic` - Since developing personalized recommendations requires complex logic, ML is an appropriate tool to consider.
2. `scalability` - Serving millions of requests for personalized recommendations every second is a challenge.
3. `personalization` - Delivering personalized recommendations at scale and being responsive at the same time is difficult to achieve with classical programming techniques.
4. `responsiveness` - The ability to deliver personalized recommendations within a few seconds even while handling millions of requests per second is expected.

## Do not use ML
1. `Can be solved with traditional algorithms` - If the problem is not overly complex, an ML solution might be overcomplicated.
2. `Does not require adapting to new data` - If data and conditions are not changing, a more traditional approach could be more appropriate.
3. `Requires 100% accuracy` - ML predictions often provide less than 100% accuracy.
4. `Requires full interpretability` - If being able to explain what is going to happen if you change the parameters or input is a priority, ML might not be the best solution.

Business reasons to avoid ML **depend** on whether traditional methods and rules are viable options, if:
- there are _few_ or _no_ requirements to adapt to new data, 
- business goals include 100% outcome accuracy, 
- models must be explained or translated.

## ML identification
To identify a good problem to solve using ML, identify your business outcome or goal, and ask these questions:
- what is the strategy to achive this goal?
- how could I use ML to achive this goal?
- what aspects of the business problem make it a good fit to apply ML?
